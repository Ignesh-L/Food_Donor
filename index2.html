          <p> Welcome to Food Donor, a platform that facilitates meaningful connections between those who want to make a difference and those in need. We offer two distinct logins to cater to both sides of this noble cause.
            The first login, labeled "DONOR," empowers individuals to contribute to the well-being of society. As a donor, you can easily donate food to Orphanages and Old Age Homes, extending a helping hand to those who require it the most.
            The second login, aptly named "Beneficiary," is designed for Orphanages and Old Age Homes seeking support. Organizations can register here to receive direct food donations, streamlining the process and ensuring that help reaches those who need it promptly.
            At Food Donor, we believe in the transformative power of collective generosity. Join us in making a positive impact on the lives of others by becoming a donor or a beneficiary today. Together, let's create a world where no one goes hungry.Welcome to Food Donor, a platform that facilitates meaningful connections between those who want to make a difference and those in need.
